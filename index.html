	<p>We all know that they were able to make it through high school, but what about college? Jenko (Channing Tatum) and Schmidt (Jonah Hill) have to go undercover to find the dealer of a new drug on campus. The drug is called wifi and helps you focus on school and then be ready for an epic party in just a couple of hours. Jenko becomes a star when he trys out for the school's football team. He ends up making a bunch of friends on the team and stops worrying about the mission and being around Schmidt. Ice Cube is living the life in his new office, but forget to tell the boys that her daughter goes to this college. It turns out this mission was nothing like last time.</p>

	<p>Ever since the last incident Tony Stark has been working on new technologies and running his very successful company. He is still trying to recover from saving New York. Given everything that happened him he likes to focus on work to get things off his mind. His relationship with his wife has been drifting because of his obsession with working on his suits. They need something that will bring them together again. Nothing would work better than a full blown battle with Mandarin and his team. Tony loses almost everything he has and has to fight this battle reconnecting with his inner self. His new technolgies also came in handy when he needed it most. Will Iron man rise to the occasion and save the world again? Or will he fail and lose everything?</p>

<h3>Why do it yoursef?</h3>
			<p>
				Don’t go to a detailer to wax your Jeep Wrangler or any other car. You can do it yourself just as well as they can. The only difference between you and them is they have equipment to get it done faster. You can also save hundreds of dollars doing this yourself. Not to mention nobody cares about your car more than you do.

	<h2>How To Wax Your Jeep</h2>

			<p>
			<b>1.</b> First you want to thoroughly wash your car with soap and water. You really want your car nice and clean before for waxing it. Anything that you wax over will not come off so this step is very important.

			<p>
			<b>2.</b> After you are done cleaning your car and your car is completely dry, it’s time to start waxing. Witch wax should you use? Preferably you are going to want to use a product that contains genuine carnauba. Products that contain this tend to be more expensive but have the best results.

			<p>
			<b>3.</b> Your wax should come with some type of pad to apply it. You want to add some wax to the pad and start rubbing it on a singular section of your vehicle. You don’t want to wax your entire car at once you want to do it in sections. This will make the wax easier to remove.

			<p> 
			<b>4.</b> You want to apply the wax in a circular motion while using 3-5 pounds of pressure. Be sure to not use too much wax as it is wasteful and makes it much harder to remove. You can also use a powered buffer to apply the wax but your own power will do just fine.

			<p>
			<b>5. </b>Wait for your wax to completely dry, different waxes take different amounts of time. You want to read the directions on the wax container to see how long you need to wait. Another way to check is to wipe your finger on the car. If the wax smears it’s not ready but if it doesn't you should be all set.

			<p>
			<b>6.</b> Next use a microfiber cloth to wipe away any wax on the car in a circular motion. If the cloth starts to drag, that's a sign that the cloth has too much buildup. You want to flip the cloth and continue wiping any of the remaining wax until you have a smooth finish.

			<p>
			<b>7.</b> Lastly, you want to fully inspect your car and make sure you didn’t miss a spot. If you notice a spot that you missed in a couple of days it’s going to be a lot harder to get off. Your wax should last anywhere between a couple of weeks and a couple of months depending on what wax you used.

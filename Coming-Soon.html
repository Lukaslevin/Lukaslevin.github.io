	<p>James Franco and Seth Rogen are featured in one of the most controversial films of all time. The film was delayed because the North Korean leader didn’t want the film to be released to the general public. The film is all about 2 TV stars on a show called Skylark Tonight. They get a chance to interview the North Korean leader and are contacted by the U.S government to assassinate him. These TV stars are in for a tough and important mission. If they do one little thing wrong they could be killed or held in North Korean prison for life. This mission doesn’t go nearly as smooth as the U.S government would have liked. Watch the movie to see if the get the job done or epicly fail.</p>
